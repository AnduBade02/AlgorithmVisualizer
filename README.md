# 📊 Algorithm Visualizer

## Project Overview

This project is a desktop application developed in **Python** using the **Pygame** library. Its primary goal is to provide a dynamic and visual representation of various algorithms, helping me to solidify my understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and gain practical experience with **Pygame**.

The application translates the abstract execution steps of an algorithm into an interactive visual experience.

## 🚀 Current Features

The project is currently a **Work In Progress (WIP)**. The following algorithm visualizations are implemented and fully functional, with options to start, pause and reset:

* **Bubble Sort**
* **Insertion Sort**

## 🛠️ Technologies & Dependencies

* **Language:** Python 3.12
* **Libraries:**
    * **Pygame** (Used for the graphical interface and real-time animations)
